In the main folder cs462 you will find work I did in the clas CMSC 462 Data Science in my undergraduate career at UMBC. In this class I worked with visualozing and performing various calculations on data to better understand it and draw more meaning from it. Data Science is used 
everywhere in the real world and the skills I obtained from this class can help any company. I primarily worked in the R programming language but I also did work with excel spreadsheets.
